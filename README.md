# Welcome
Welcome to the technical documentation site for the OpenDevICON project!

In this documentation youâ€™ll find information on:

- An overview of OpendevICON
- Tutorials to get you started with [**Python SDK**](docs/prerequisites.md) and [**Jupyter Notebook**](docs/scoreInteraction.md)
- Reference to [**SCORE library**](docs/deck.md)

## About OpenDevICON
**OpenDevICON** is an initiative to support ICON developers by reducing friction and wasted time in development of ICON SCOREs, dApps and DAOs.
The vision for this project is to build a resource and reference hub with tools, tutorials, articles on best practices, and reusable code. As a developer hub, it will provide secure, audited, and reusable open source SCORE code along with tools to help the deployment and management of ICON smart contracts.

## Current Status
OpenDevICON is currently at the starting phase and we believe it to make a good impact as we move forward. While we plan to continue this for long term growth of ICON, we are very pleased to have support from the foundation and ICON community. With OpenDevICON we hope to continue bringing more people and ideas to this platform. While it is certainly going to take some time, our project will help us reach our goal to the earliest possible.
