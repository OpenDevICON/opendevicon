# IRC2 Mintable
IRC2 Mintable tokens are IRC2-compatible tokens with one added feature: new tokens can be created at any time and added to total supply. Standard IRC2 tokens don't have this feature, which makes them a fixed supply tokens.

New tokens can be minted only by owner of the contract which is set when the SCORE is first deployed or updated.
