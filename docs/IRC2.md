# IRC2 Token

A token is a representation of something in blockchain. This something can be money, services, shares in a company or anything. By representing something as tokens, we can allow smart contract to interact with them. 

IRC2 token is a standard token equivalent to [ERC20]() for [ICON](https://icon.foundation/?lang=en) blockchain. It helps to keep track of [fungible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility) tokens. 

There are a few core contracts to implement IRC2 token.
* IIRC2: Interface IRC2 methods should confirm into.
* IRC2: The base implementation of IRC2 contract.
