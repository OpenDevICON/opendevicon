# IRC2 Burnable
IRC2 Burnable tokens are IRC2-compatible tokens with one added feature: tokens can be burned(destroyed) at any time and reduced from the total supply. Standard IRC2 tokens don't have this feature, which makes them a fixed supply tokens.

Tokens can be burnt only by owner of the contract which is set when the SCORE is first deployed or updated.
